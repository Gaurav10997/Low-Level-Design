# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle is a key concept in SOLID principles. It emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but instead both should depend on abstractions.

---

## Key Points

1. **Definition**:
   - High-level modules (business logic) should not depend on low-level modules (implementation details).
   - Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes).

2. **Focus**:
   - Reduces tight coupling between different layers of an application.
   - Makes the system easier to modify and extend.

3. **Requirements**:
   - Abstractions should not depend on details.
   - Details should depend on abstractions.

4. **Violations**:
   - A class directly instantiates another class, tightly coupling their behaviors.
   - A high-level module breaks when a low-level module changes.

5. **Example of Violation**:

   ```java
   class EmailService {
       public void sendEmail(String message) {
           System.out.println("Email sent: " + message);
       }
   }

   class Notification {
       private EmailService emailService;

       public Notification() {
           this.emailService = new EmailService(); // Tight coupling to EmailService
       }

       public void notifyUser(String message) {
           emailService.sendEmail(message);
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Correct Implementation**:

   ```java
   interface MessageService {
       void sendMessage(String message);
   }

   class EmailService implements MessageService {
       public void sendMessage(String message) {
           System.out.println("Email sent: " + message);
       }
   }

   class Notification {
       private MessageService messageService;

       public Notification(MessageService messageService) {
           this.messageService = messageService; // Dependency injection via abstraction
       }

       public void notifyUser(String message) {
           messageService.sendMessage(message);
       }
   }

   // Usage:
   MessageService emailService = new EmailService();
   Notification notification = new Notification(emailService);
   notification.notifyUser("Hello, User!");
   ```

## Benefits of DIP

1. Promotes **flexibility** by allowing easy substitution of low-level implementations.
2. Enhances **testability** as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed.
3. Supports **scalability** since changes in low-level modules do not ripple through the system.

## Good Practices to Ensure DIP

1. Rely on **interfaces or abstract classes** for dependencies.
2. Use **Dependency Injection** frameworks or patterns.
3. Avoid direct instantiation of dependent classes in high-level modules.
